## Introduction to Frequency-modulated continuous-wave radar (FM-CW)
FMCW is a short-range measuring radar set that operates in real-time and is suited for surveillance applications in transport systems. The transceiver in this system operates in X-band, with a single transmitter and multiple receivers. The signal processing chain includes region of interest selection, multidimensional fast Fourier transform, peak detection.
